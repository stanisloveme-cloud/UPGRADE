# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. RULES (THE "DO NOT" LIST)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
rules:
  # --- UI & Design System ---
  - id: "ui-strict-antd"
    severity: "critical"
    description: "Do NOT use custom CSS for layout. Use <ProLayout>, <ProCard>, <Space> and Ant Design Tokens only."
  
  - id: "ui-form-patterns"
    severity: "error"
    description: "For entity editing (Session, Speaker), ALWAYS use <DrawerForm> or <ModalForm>. Do not build raw HTML forms."

  # --- Backend Architecture ---
  - id: "be-modular-structure"
    severity: "error"
    description: "Enforce NestJS Modular Architecture: Module -> Controller -> Service -> Repository. No logic in Controllers."

  # --- Infrastructure & Release ---
  - id: "infra-immutable"
    severity: "critical"
    description: "Never suggest editing files directly on the server via SSH. All config changes must go through Git."
  
  - id: "infra-secrets-safety"
    severity: "critical"
    description: "Never commit .env files. Use .env.example for templates. Secrets are managed via CI/CD variables."

  # --- Shell & Execution Stability (CRITICAL) ---
  - id: "shell-no-blocking"
    severity: "critical"
    description: >
      ABSOLUTE BAN on running blocking commands.
      NEVER run: 'npm run start', 'nest start --watch', 'docker-compose up' (without -d).
      ACTION: Ask the User to run servers in a separate terminal.

  - id: "shell-path-awareness"
    severity: "critical"
    description: >
      PROJECT STRUCTURE TRUTH (DO NOT HALLUCINATE):
      - Frontend is in `./client` (NOT /frontend).
      - Backend is in `./src` (NOT /backend).
      - Infrastructure files are in `./` (Root), NOT /infra.
      ALWAYS adjust paths in commands and imports accordingly.

  - id: "infra-code-only"
    severity: "critical"
    description: >
      Infrastructure (Docker, Nginx, GitHub Actions) must be code.
      If `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is missing, IT MUST BE CREATED based on the actual folder structure.

  - id: "shell-powershell-compat"
    severity: "error"
    description: >
      Windows Environment Detected.
      1. DO NOT use `grep`, `touch`, `rm -rf`, `export`. Use PowerShell equivalents (`Select-String`, `New-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `$env:VAR=VAL`).
      2. Avoid complex chaining (&&). Execute commands sequentially.
      3. Always assume non-interactive mode.
