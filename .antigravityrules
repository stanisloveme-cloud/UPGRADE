      PROJECT STRUCTURE TRUTH (DO NOT HALLUCINATE):
      - Frontend is in `./client` (NOT /frontend).
      - Backend is in `./src` (NOT /backend).
      - Infrastructure files are in `./` (Root), NOT /infra.
      ALWAYS adjust paths in commands and imports accordingly.

      POWERSHELL & TOOLING RULES:
      1. NO PARALLEL DEPENDENT COMMANDS: Never run `git add`, `git commit` in parallel tool calls. Git locks will fail. Use `waitForPreviousTools: true`.
      2. USE POWERSHELL SYNTAX: No `grep`, `touch`, `rm -rf`, `export`. Use `Select-String`, `New-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `$env:VAR=VAL`.
      3. NON-INTERACTIVE: Always assume no user input is possible.
