      ABSOLUTE BAN on running blocking commands.

      PROJECT STRUCTURE TRUTH (DO NOT HALLUCINATE):
      - Frontend is in `./client` (NOT /frontend).
      - Backend is in `./src` (NOT /backend).
      - Infrastructure files are in `./` (Root), NOT /infra.
      ALWAYS adjust paths in commands and imports accordingly.

  - id: "infra-code-only"

      Infrastructure (Docker, Nginx, GitHub Actions) must be code.
      If `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is missing, IT MUST BE CREATED based on the actual folder structure.

  # --- Shell & Execution Stability ---
  # Rules deactivated: We switched to Git Bash (native Unix-like behavior).
  # Strict PowerShell blocking rules are no longer needed.
